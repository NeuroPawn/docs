# System Requirements

The **NeuroPawn Desktop Application** supports real-time EEG acquisition and analysis using USB-connected EEG hardware sampling at **125 Hz**. This section outlines the minimum and recommended system specifications required for smooth operation across major platforms.

## âœ… Supported Platforms

The NeuroPawn application is cross-platform and compatible with:

- **Windows** 10 and later (x64)
- **macOS** 11 (Big Sur) and later (Intel or Apple Silicon)
- **Linux** (Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian-based distros recommended)

---

## ðŸ§  EEG Hardware Interface Requirements

- **Connection Type**: USB-C serial communication  
- **Sampling Rate**: 125 Hz  
- **Data Format**: Typical 24-bit resolution, multichannel (e.g., 8â€“16 channels)

> Ensure the EEG device is properly recognized by the system as a serial (COM/tty) port.

## ðŸ“¦ Additional Notes

- The NeuroPawn app requires **serial port access**.  
  - On **Linux/macOS**, you may need to add your user to appropriate groups (e.g., `dialout`, `tty`).
- Real-time data logging may consume additional disk space over time â€” ensure sufficient storage if recording continuously.
- CPU and RAM usage scales with the number of EEG channels and enabled signal processing modules (e.g., filtering, artifact removal).
